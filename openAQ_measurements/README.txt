This is data that has been pulled from the OpenAQ api: https://docs.openaq.org. The data represents hourly avarages for every sensor currently availible in Canada between 2023-05-01 and 2023-09-30. That data was then summarized into mean, max, min, and quantiles per sensor. Files with dates in them are intermediate files representing the results of the API call at a specific time. The two final files are 'Summary_statistics_pm2.5_sensors_in_CA.csv', and 'Locations_formatted.csv'. Summary_statistics_pm2.5_sensors_in_CA.csv contains the summary statistics. Locations_formatted.csv lists all the sensors in Canada with pm2.5. 

Note: Hourly summary statistics were calculated from all sensors with any data during that summer, including sensors that started or ended thier record part of the way through the summer.
